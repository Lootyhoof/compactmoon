# Compact Moon
![Preview](http://i68.tinypic.com/iee1c8.png)

Fork of the theme [Classic Compact] (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classic-compact/) by Ken Barbalace for Pale Moon.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder  and pack the contents of both the "options" and "theme" folders into a .zip file each. Then, rename the files to .xpi. Pack both of these XPI files with the install.rdf file in the "src" folder into another .xpi. Then, drag into the browser. You can install these separately if you wish, however it is strongly advised to install together.

## Download
You can grab the latest release either from the Releases section of this repository, or the [Pale Moon Add-Ons Site](https://addons.palemoon.org/themes/complete/compact-moon-theme/).
